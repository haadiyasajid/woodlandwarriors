# ABOUT THE GAME
This is a basic fighting game I developed in vanilla JavaScript, using no libraries, just HTML canvas. <br>
Player 1: Can only attack towards right. Use a,w,d for movement and Shift to attack. <br>
Player 2: Can only attack towards left. Use up,left,right arrow keys for movement and Space to attack. <br>
Health potion bottles spawn randomly, jump around to grab them before your opponent does, or before they disappear! <br>
Whoever stays alive wins, or if 60 seconds elapse, whoever has more health at the end of timer wins. <br> 

__Note__:
Many important controls, such as gravity, speed, max health, attack power, etc, can be controlled using the consts
which are defined at the beginning of script.js. 

I made this game just to practice and learn JavaScript! Contributions are very welcome!
